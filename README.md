#What is Project Euler

From the [website](http://www.projecteuler.net) itself,

>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

>The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

So, basically I'm just adding my own "solutions" to these problems. Watch out for the solution for number three, "primeFactorization.js" as it freezes my browser.

##Future Plans?
I'll be adding solutions to these in other languages (probably in PHP, maybe Ruby) aside from JavaScript. I don't plan on contributing often so we'll see how often I come back :)
